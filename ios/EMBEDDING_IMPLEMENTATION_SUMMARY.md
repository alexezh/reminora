   - Handles Data serialization for Core Data storage

2. **Place+Embedding.swift**
   - Extends Place entity with embedding functionality
   - Provides embedding storage/retrieval methods
   - Includes similarity search capabilities
   - PlaceEmbeddingManager for batch operations

3. **SimilarImagesView.swift**
   - Complete UI for viewing similar images
   - Adjustable similarity thresholds (50%-95%)
   - Statistics on embedding coverage
   - Batch processing for missing embeddings
   - Grid view with similarity percentages and rankings

### UI Integration

4. **SwipePhotoView Integration**
   - Added "Similar" button to photo viewer action bar
   - Replaces Pin button with Similar functionality
   - Automatic embedding computation for current photo
   - Sheet presentation for SimilarImagesView

### Data Management

5. **Embedding Storage**
   - Uses `setValue(forKey: "imageEmbedding")` for Core Data storage
   - Binary data storage with external storage support
   - Automatic background computation for new photos
   - Migration-safe approach (no schema changes required)

## Features

### ✅ Image Similarity Search
- Find visually similar images with adjustable thresholds
- Cosine similarity comparison between embedding vectors
- Support for batch processing all photos

### ✅ Duplicate Detection
- Identify potential duplicate photos (95%+ similarity)
- Group similar images together
- Statistics on duplicate groups

### ✅ Performance Optimization
- Background embedding computation
- External storage for large vectors
- Efficient similarity queries with NSPredicate

### ✅ User Experience
- "Similar" button in photo viewer
- Adjustable similarity thresholds (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%)
- Visual similarity rankings and percentages
- Progress indicators for batch processing
- Coverage statistics showing analysis progress

## Technical Specifications

- **Embedding Size**: Variable (Vision framework optimized)
- **Model**: Apple Vision Framework (`VNGenerateImageFeaturePrintRequest`)
- **Storage**: Binary Data in Core Data with external storage
- **Similarity**: Cosine similarity between feature vectors
- **Performance**: Background computation, non-blocking UI

## Benefits

1. **Find Similar Photos**: Discover visually similar images in your library
2. **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and manage duplicate photos
3. **Enhanced Browsing**: Explore photos by visual similarity
4. **Smart Organization**: Group photos by visual characteristics
5. **Efficient Storage**: Automatic management of embedding vectors

## Usage Instructions

### Viewing Similar Images
1. Open any photo in the SwipePhotoView
2. Tap the "Similar" button (photo stack icon)
3. Adjust similarity threshold using percentage buttons
4. Browse similar images with similarity scores

### Computing Missing Embeddings
1. In SimilarImagesView, tap "Compute Missing"
2. Wait for batch processing to complete
3. View updated coverage statistics

### Finding Duplicates
- Use 95% threshold to find near-duplicates
- Use lower thresholds (70-80%) for similar compositions
- Use 50-60% for broad visual similarity

## Core Data Model Note

The implementation uses `setValue(forKey:)` to store embeddings without requiring Core Data model changes. For production, consider adding an official `imageEmbedding: Binary Data` attribute to the Place entity in the .xcdatamodeld file.

## Dependencies

- **Vision Framework**: For image feature extraction
- **Core ML**: For machine learning infrastructure
- **Core Data**: For embedding persistence
- **SwiftUI**: For user interface
- **UIKit**: For image processing

All dependencies are part of the iOS SDK - no external libraries required.
