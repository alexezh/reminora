# Reminora

Reminora began as a geotagged photo sharing app with list management and social features.
It has since evolved into a focused, privacy-friendly tool for everyday photo and video management, built around the idea of lists ‚Äî lightweight, flexible collections inspired by Lightroom Quick Lists. 

Reminora helps you capture, organize, and rediscover moments without the overhead of traditional gallery apps or the complexity of pro editors.

- List-based organization: create quick, ad-hoc collections for trips, themes, or projects.
- Integrated editing tools: more capable than stock photo apps, yet simpler than GIMP.
- Geotag support: explore photos by place and memory context.
- Lightweight and private: built for personal use, not social media.

Reminora is a second iteration of [kouki2](https://github.com/alexezh/kouki2) focusing on phone as a primary device
