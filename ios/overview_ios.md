# Reminora iOS App Overview

## Application Overview

Reminora is a sophisticated geotagged photo sharing iOS application built with SwiftUI. The app enables users to organize their photo library, save photos with location data, view them on an interactive map, and manage collections through a flexible list system.

## Core Features

### 1. Photo Library Management

### 3. Quick List System
- **Quick Collection**: Temporarily collect photos and pins for organization
- **One-Touch Adding**: Add photos/pins to Quick List with circle button overlay
- **Batch Operations**: Perform actions on multiple items simultaneously
- **Smart Organization**: Mixed content support (photos and pins together)

### 4. List Management
- **User Lists**: Create custom lists to organize photos and pins
- **List Actions**: Create, rename, and manage multiple lists
- **Mixed Content**: Lists can contain both photos and location pins
- **Cross-List Operations**: Move items between lists efficiently

### 5. Share Extension
- **System Integration**: Share photos to Reminora from other apps
- **Location Processing**: Extract and save location data from shared photos
- **App Group Support**: Shared Core Data between main app and extension

## Technical Architecture

### Quick List Workflow

1. **Adding Items**:
   - Tap circle button on photos in PhotoStackView
   - Tap circle button in SwipePhotoView
   - Add pins from PinDetailView "Quick" button

2. **Managing Quick List**:
   - Access through Lists tab â†’ Quick List
   - Menu actions via ellipsis button in RListDetailView
   - Three main actions: Create List, Add to List, Clear Quick

3. **Create List Action**:
   - Prompts for new list name
   - Moves all Quick List items to new list
   - Clears Quick List and returns to main lists view

4. **Add to List Action**:
   - Shows picker with existing lists
   - Moves all Quick List items to selected list
   - Clears Quick List and returns to main lists view

5. **Clear Quick Action**:
   - Shows confirmation dialog
   - Removes all items from Quick List
   - Returns to main lists view

## User Interface Design

### Navigation Structure
- **Tab-based**: Four main tabs (Photos, Map, Lists, Profile)
- **Contextual Actions**: Actions available based on current context
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe navigation and pull-to-refresh

### Visual Design
- **iOS-native**: Follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
- **Haptic Feedback**: Tactile responses for user interactions
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver and accessibility support
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic system appearance adaptation

### Photo Display

- **Full-Screen View**: Immersive photo viewing experience
- **Overlay Controls**: Non-intrusive action buttons
- **Stack Indicators**: Visual cues for photo groupings

## Data Flow

### Photo Processing Pipeline
1. **Photo Selection**: User selects photos from library
2. **Metadata Extraction**: GPS and EXIF data processing
3. **Image Optimization**: Downsampling for storage efficiency
4. **Core Data Storage**: Persistent local storage
5. **Display Rendering**: UI updates with new content

### Quick List Operations
1. **Item Addition**: Photos/pins added to Quick List
2. **Batch Processing**: Multiple items handled simultaneously
3. **List Creation**: Quick List items moved to permanent lists
4. **Notification Updates**: UI refreshes across all views
5. **Data Persistence**: Changes saved to Core Data

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management
- **Lazy Loading**: Photos loaded on-demand
- **Image Caching**: Efficient thumbnail management
